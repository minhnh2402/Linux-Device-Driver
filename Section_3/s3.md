# **1. Linux Architecture**
Linux is primarily divided into User Space & Kernel Space. These two components interact through a System Call Interface – which is a predefined and matured interface to Linux Kernel for Userspace applications.

## **Kernel Space**

Kernel space is where the kernel (i.e. the core of the operating system) executes (i.e. runs) and provides its services.
## **User Space**

User Space is where the user applications are executed.

# **2. Linux Kernel Module**
Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.

Custom codes can be added to Linux kernels via two methods.
* Add the code to the kernel source tree and recompile the kernel.
* Add code to the kernel while it is running. 
  
Since we are loading these codes at runtime, and they are not part of the official Linux kernel, these are called loadable kernel modules (LKM), which is different from the “base kernel”. The base kernel is located in the /boot directory and is always loaded when we boot our machine, whereas LKMs are loaded after the base kernel is already loaded.

Nonetheless, this LKM is very much part of our kernel, and they communicate with the base kernel to complete their functions.

Loadable kernel modules serve various purposes, but the most common applications are

* Device drivers

* Filesystem drivers

* System calls

# **3. Linux Device Drivers**

A device driver is a particular form of software application that is designed to enable interaction with hardware devices. Without the required device driver, the corresponding hardware device fails to work.

A device driver usually communicates with the hardware by means of the communications subsystem or computer bus to which the hardware is connected. Device drivers are operating system-specific and hardware-dependent. A device driver acts as a translator between the hardware device and the programs or operating systems that use it.

In the traditional classification, there are three kinds of the device (device files):
* Character device
* Block device
* Network device

*brw-rw----- -> b: Block device*  
*crw-------- -> c: Character device*

In Linux, everything is a file. Linux treats everything as a file even hardware.
## 3.1. Character Device
Character driver accesses data from the device sequentially. i.e., byte by byte (like a stream of characters) not as a chunk of data.  
Char devices: sensors, RTC, keyboard, serial port, parallel port, etc.
## 3.2. Block Device
The device which handles data in chunks or blocks is called a block device.  
Block driver are more complicated than char drivers because block drivers should implement advanced buffering strategies to read and write to the block devices, and disk caches are involed.  
Block devices: mass storage devices such as hard disks, SDMMC, Nand flash, USB camera, etc.
## 3.3. Network Device
